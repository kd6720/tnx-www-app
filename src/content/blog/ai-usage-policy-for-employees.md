An AI usage policy for employees is a short document that settles three things: which AI tools people may use at work, what company and customer data may go into them, and who checks the output before it reaches a customer. It gets followed when it is specific enough to consult in the middle of a task, and it gets ignored when it restates the company's values. Most policies fail for one plain reason: they were written to satisfy a compliance file rather than to help somebody who is behind on a deliverable.

## What an AI Usage Policy for Employees Has to Decide

There are four decisions, in order: approved tools, permitted data, required disclosure, and who owns an exception. If any one of the four is missing, the employee makes that call themselves — usually under deadline, and usually with whichever tool is already open on their screen.

A policy that says "use AI responsibly" hands the whole decision to the person least equipped to make it. A policy that says "drafting, summarizing and research are approved in these tools; customer data never leaves the company tenant; anything a customer receives is reviewed by the account owner" gives that person an answer they can act on in ten seconds.

The [NIST AI Risk Management Framework](https://www.nist.gov/itl/ai-risk-management-framework) is a reasonable structure to hang the document on. NIST describes it as intended for voluntary use — which matters here, because it gives you a defensible way to organize risk without pretending to be a regulation you could be cited against.

## Start With Approved Use Cases, Not a Tool List

Teams usually start by listing tools, argue about them for a month, and ship a document that goes stale the week the next model is released. Start with tasks instead, grouped into three tiers:

- **Approved.** Everyday drafting, summarizing, research, code assistance and internal search, inside tools the company has provisioned.
- **Conditional.** Work that touches customer records, pricing or commitments. Allowed only in the approved tenant, and only with a named reviewer.
- **Not approved.** Regulated data, anything that creates a legal or financial commitment on the company's behalf, and any tool without a business agreement and data controls behind it.

The tier list is the part that survives a tool change. When the next model arrives, the question is not whether it appears on a list — it is which tier that work belongs to. That framing also makes the rule legible to the people doing the work, which is the same discipline behind [workflow patterns that hold up in production](/blog/ai-workflows-that-work-patterns-for-telecom).

## Data Rules: What May Go Into an AI Tool

Data is where most policies get vague and most incidents begin. Classify what the business actually holds — public material, internal material, customer personal data, and anything regulated by contract or law — then state plainly what may go into which tier.

Two rules carry most of the weight.

**The approved tool is the only tool for company data.** Not because a general-purpose chatbot is unsafe in the abstract, but because you cannot answer a customer's question about where their information went if you cannot name where it went. Consumer accounts also commonly use submitted content to improve models; a business tenant with retention controls does not.

**Retention is a policy decision, not a setting you discover later.** Decide whether prompts and outputs are retained, for how long, and who can read them. If the honest answer is "we don't know", that is the first item on the list. Working that out is the same exercise the [AI readiness checklist](/blog/ai-readiness-checklist-for-midsize-organizations) starts from: name the data you hold, then name who may touch it.

## Disclosure: When Your Team Has to Say AI Was Used

Disclosure rules are easiest to follow when they attach to a deliverable rather than to a feeling. A workable line: internal drafts need no announcement, and anything a customer receives should come from a person accountable for it, whether or not AI helped write it.

That leaves three places where a policy has to be explicit — content published under the company's name, communications that make commitments, and any conversation where a customer asks directly. The last one is not a hard case. The answer is the truth, and the policy should say so before anyone has to improvise it, the same way an honest handoff script beats a bot that keeps guessing: [design the moment a bot hands off to a person](/blog/ai-to-human-handoff) and the disclosure question mostly answers itself.

## Exceptions, Ownership, and the Review Cycle

Name one owner. A policy owned by "legal and IT" is owned by nobody, and every exception becomes a negotiation. Name a person who can approve an exception within a day, and record what was approved — that record is what turns a pile of one-offs into the next version of the policy.

Then set the review cadence to the pace of the tools, not to the calendar year. Quarterly is usually enough, provided the exception log is actually read when the review happens. If the team has not settled who owns AI decisions yet, the questions in the [AI readiness assessment](/tools/ai-readiness) are a faster starting point than a policy draft, because they surface the gaps a policy would otherwise paper over.

## How to Get the Policy Actually Followed

Adoption is a design problem, not a communication problem. Four moves do most of the work:

**Make the approved path the easy path.** If the sanctioned tool is one click away and already signed in, most people use it. If it requires a ticket, they will not.

**Train on tasks, not on the document.** A short walkthrough of the three tasks the team does every week beats a policy acknowledgment nobody reads.

**Say what happens when someone asks.** The most common reason people hide AI use is fear of an unknown consequence. A policy that describes the first conversation after a mistake gets more honest reporting than one that leads with discipline.

**Fix the policy when it is wrong.** A rule that everyone breaks is usually a bad rule. Treat the exception log as feedback and revise on the review date, not in the middle of an argument.

A policy is a one-page decision aid, not an artifact for the compliance file. If it does not answer the question in front of an employee at the moment they have it, the team will route around it. [AI consulting](/ai-consulting) is how those decisions become configuration — which tools, which data, which reviews, and who owns the exceptions. [Ask us to look at yours.](/contact)
